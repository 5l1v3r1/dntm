## On running the experiments

The different models are implemented as simple prototypes in `state.py`. `train.py` gets an argument `--exp` as the name of the prototype to run a particular model. Note that the recommended method to run the experiments is to use the scripts under the root `./scripts` directory.

The data iterators for the NTM tasks are under `ntm_tasks/` folder.
