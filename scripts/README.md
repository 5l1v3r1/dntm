## On Running the Experiments
See the `run_*.sh` scripts to be able to run the different models. Those shell scripts will be calling the associated `train_*.py` python script to run the experiments. For example to run the D-NTM model on copy tasks you can run the `run_copy.sh` script. 

## WARNING
Note that this folder contains scripts to run the experiments and the models using MANNs. Note
that some of the scripts may not work due to the refactoring and the changes in the paths of the
files. 

This issue will be fixed very soon.
